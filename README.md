Solution

The problem, as I understand it, is to produce a web app that allows its user
to select a series tag and a series under that tag, and then view the details
for that series.  Moreover, the task is to do so without the use of a framework
and while exemplifying mastery in:

1. working with a dataset
2. handling templating & DOM manipulation
3. binding events to DOM actions
4. organizing classes

Additionally, it helps to show mastery in implementing:

1. styling
2. animations
3. null-case handling, specifically for if there's no series for tag
4. selectively disabling buttons, specifically the clear button

Approach

1. First things first, load the real data and present it 
2. Then, create event handlers for when data is selected & show selected data
3. Then, create event handlers for when a series is selected & show selected data
4. Then, add null-case handling and selective disabling
5. Spruce up styling
6. Add some animations
7. Create multiple subcomponents (challenge accepted)

Notes from implementing solution:

* better than displaying 'none selected', or something to that effect, I select
a tag by default, which solves the same problem, but has the added utility of 
enticing the user with some content
